                <h2>REST API</h2>

                <p>We have our "CRUD" operations in the "RestService".
                    The "RestService" has access to the "Facade" class, which has a connection to the database. The RESTful API is just
                    a simple collection of URIs, HTTP calls to those URIs and some JSON representations of resoursces, many of which contain
                    relational links. Each resouse has its own address or URI - every thing the server can provide is exposed as a resource.

                <h2>JSON Format</h2>
                <p>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a data-interchange format. It is easy to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and 
                    generate. It is based on a subset of the Javascript Programming Language. JSON is a collection of name/value pairs. </p>

                <p>We tested our own (not login part) by using postman. Here's some pics</p>
                
                <p>Our tests focus on our database facade of the test of common CRUD operations. This tests our facade connected to our database and our facade receives data from the database </p>
